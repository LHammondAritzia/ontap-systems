After completing the hardware replacement and booting to Maintenance mode, you verify the low-level system configuration of the replacement controller and reconfigure system settings as necessary.

== Step 1: Set and verify system time

include::../_include/set_time_after_controller_rep.adoc[]

== Step 2:  Verify and set the controller's HA state

You must verify the `HA` state of the controller module and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

. In Maintenance mode from the new controller module, verify that all components display the same `HA` state: `ha-config show`
+
The HA state should be the same for all components.

. If the displayed system state for the chassis does not match your system configuration:
 .. Set the HA state for the chassis: `ha-config modify chassis _HA-state_`
+
The value for HA-state can be one of the following:

*** `ha`
*** `mcc`
*** `mcc-2n`
*** `mccip`
*** `non-ha`

 .. Confirm that the setting has changed: `ha-config show`
