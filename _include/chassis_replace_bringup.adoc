After replacing the chassis, power up the cluster components in the following order:

* Power up the switch
* Power up the drive shelves
* Power up the controllers

.Steps

. Power up the switch
.. Plug back in each power cable from PDU to PSU.
.. Flip each PSU rocker switch to the ON position (if applicable).
.. Wait for the switch to power up.
.. Check for any fault lights on the switch (both front and back).
.. Connect to the switch via the management IP address.
.. Confirm switch health (refer to the switch vendor documentation for more details).
.. Repeat for each switch until all switches are powered up and healthy.

. Power up the drive shelves
.. Plug back in each power cable from PDU to PSU.
.. Flip each PSU rocker switch to the ON position (if applicable).
.. Wait for all the disk shelves to power up and for the drives to spin up.
.. Ensure all shelf IDs are the expected values.
.. Check for any fault lights on the disk shelf (both front and back) that did not exist before the shutdown.
. Power up the controllers
.. Plug back in each power cable from PDU to PSU.
.. Flip each PSU rocker switch to the ON position (if applicable). HA pairs that are not in the same chassis should be powered up simultaneously.
.. Wait for the controllers in the chassis to power up.
.. Check for any fault lights on the chassis and controllers (both front and back).
.. Repeat for each controller/chassis until all are powered up.
.. Connect to the SP or BMC IP address of the nodes via SSH. Use this command to get the IP address before powering down: 
+
`system service-processor show -node * -fields address`

.. Perform additional system health checks:

... Check system health as described in https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP[How to perform a cluster health check with a script in ONTAP]
.. Generate a maintenance task complete AutoSupport message:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`

.. Make sure autogiveback is active: 
+
`storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`
