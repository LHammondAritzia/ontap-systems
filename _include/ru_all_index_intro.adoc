This guide describes how to upgrade the controller hardware without disruption by using aggregate relocation.

You can nondisruptively upgrade the controller hardware on a pair of nodes running NetApp ONTAP by migrating non-root aggregates from the original nodes to the new nodes in the same cluster. The data hosted on the nodes that are being upgraded is accessible during the upgrade.

This procedure uses a method called aggregate relocation (ARL), which takes advantage of the HA configuration to enable you to move ownership of non-root aggregates from one node to another if they share storage within the same cluster.

Before you start, review the list of ARL guides in the table below to verify that you have selected the correct guide for your controller hardware upgrade.
