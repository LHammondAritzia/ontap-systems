If you are upgrading from an AFF A300 to an AFF A400 platform in a two-node switchless cluster configuration, you must pick temporary cluster ports for the controller upgrade. The AFF A400 platform comes in two configurations, as an Ethernet bundle where the mezzanine card ports are Ethernet type and as an FC bundle where the mezzanine ports are FC type.

* For an AFF A400 with an Ethernet type configuration, you can use any of the two mezzanine ports as temporary cluster ports.

* For an AFF A400 with an FC type configuration, you must add a four-port 10 GbE network interface card (part number X1147A) to provide temporary cluster ports.

* After you complete a controller upgrade by using temporary cluster ports, you can nondisruptively migrate cluster LIFs to e3a and e3b 100 GbE ports on an AFF A400 platform and e0c and e0d 100 GbE ports on an FAS8300 platform.

If you prefer a different method of upgrading the controller hardware and are willing to do volume moves, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Controller Hardware Upgrade Express Guide_.
