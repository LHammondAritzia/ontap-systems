After you physically rack node3 and node4 later in the procedure, you might need to netboot them. The term "netboot" means you are booting from an ONTAP image stored on a remote server. When preparing for netboot, you must put a copy of the ONTAP 9 boot image onto a web server that the system can access.

.Before you begin

* Verify that you can access a HTTP server with the system.
* You need to download the necessary system files for your platform and the correct version of ONTAP from the _NetApp Support Site_. Refer to link:other_references.html[Other references] to link to the _NetApp Support Site_.

.About this task

You must netboot the new controllers if they do not have the same version of ONTAP 9 installed on them that is installed on the original controllers. After you install each new controller, you boot the system from the ONTAP 9 image stored on the web server. You can then download the correct files to the boot media device for subsequent system boots.
