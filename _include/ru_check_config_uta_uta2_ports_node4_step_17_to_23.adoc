. [[Step17]]Press Ctrl-C during autoboot to stop the node at the `LOADER>` prompt.

. At the loader prompt, enter maintenance mode by using the following command:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

. In maintenance mode, display all the previously set initiator ports that are now in target mode by using the following command:
+
`ucadmin show`
+
Change the ports back to initiator mode by using the following command:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator -f <adapter name>`

. Verify that the ports have been changed to initiator mode by using the following command:
+
`ucadmin show`

. Exit maintenance mode by using the following command:
+
`halt`

. [[Step22]]At the loader prompt boot up by using the following command:
+
`boot_ontap`
+
Now, on booting, the node can detect all the disks that were previously assigned to it and can boot up as expected.

. [[Step23]]If you are upgrading from a system with external disks to a system that supports internal and external disks (AFF A800 systems, for example), set the node2 aggregate as the root aggregate to ensure node4 boots from the root aggregate of node2. To set the root aggregate, go to the boot menu and select option `5` to enter maintenance mode.

WARNING: You must perform the following substeps in the exact order shown; failure to do so might cause an outage or even data loss.

+
The following procedure sets node4 to boot from the root aggregate of node2:

.. Enter maintenance mode by using the following command:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

.. Check the RAID, plex, and checksum information for the node2 aggregate by using the following command:
+
`aggr status -r`

.. Check the status of the node2 aggregate by using the following command:
+
`aggr status`

.. If necessary, bring the node2 aggregate online by using the following command:
+
`aggr_online root_aggr_from_<node2>`

.. Prevent the node4 from booting from its original root aggregate by using the following command:
+
`aggr offline <root_aggr_on_node4>`

.. Set the node2 root aggregate as the new root aggregate for node4 by using the following command:
+
`aggr options aggr_from_<node2> root`
