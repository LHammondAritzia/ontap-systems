After you physically rack node3 and node4 later in the procedure, you might need to netboot them. The term "netboot" means you are booting from an ONTAP image stored on a remote server. When preparing for netboot, you must put a copy of the ONTAP 9 boot image onto a web server that the system can access.

.Before you begin

* Verify that you can access a HTTP server with the system.
* You need to download the necessary system files for your platform and the correct version of ONTAP from the NetApp Support Site at link:https://mysupport.netapp.com[mysupport.netapp.com].

.About this task

You must netboot the new controllers if they do not have the same version of ONTAP 9 installed on them that is installed on the original controllers. After you install each new controller, you boot the system from the ONTAP 9 image stored on the web server. You can then download the correct files to the boot media device for subsequent system boots.

.Steps

. Access the NetApp Support Site to download the files used for performing the netboot of the system.
. Download the appropriate ONTAP software from the software download section of the NetApp Support Site and store the `<ontap_version>_image.tgz` file on a web-accessible directory.
. Change to the web-accessible directory and verify that the files you need are available.

|FAS/AFF8000 series systems
|Extract the contents of the `<ontap_version>_image.tgz` file to the target directory by using the following command:
`tar -zxvf <ontap_version>_image.tgz`
*Note*: If you are extracting the contents on Windows, use 7-Zip or WinRAR to extract the netboot image.
Your directory listing should contain a netboot folder with a kernel file:
`netboot/kernel`

|All other systems
|Your directory listing should contain the following file:
`<ontap_version>_image.tgz`
*Note*: You do not need to extract the contents of the `<ontap_version>_image.tgz` file.
