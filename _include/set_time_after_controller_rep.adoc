You should check the time and date on the replacement controller module against the healthy controller module in an HA pair, or against a reliable time server in a stand-alone configuration. If the time and date do not match, you must reset them on the replacement controller module to prevent possible outages on clients due to time differences.

.About this task
It is important that you apply the commands in the steps on the correct systems:

* The _replacement_ node is the new node that replaced the impaired node as part of this procedure.
* The _healhy node_ is the HA partner of the replacement node

.Steps
. If the replacement node is not at the LOADER prompt, halt the system to the LOADER prompt.
. On the healthy node, check the system time: `show date`
+
The date and time are given in GMT.

. At the LOADER prompt, check the date and time on the replacement node: `show date`
+
The date and time are given in GMT.

. If necessary, set the date in GMT on the replacement node: `set _date mm/dd/yyyy_`
. If necessary, set the time in GMT on the replacement node: `set time _hh:mm:ss_`
. At the LOADER prompt, confirm the date and time on the replacement node: `show date`
+
The date and time are given in GMT.
