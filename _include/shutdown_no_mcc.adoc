To shut down the impaired controller, you must determine the status of the controller and, if necessary, take over the controller so that the healthy controller continues to serve data from the impaired controller storage.

If you have a cluster with more than two nodes, it must be in quorum. If the cluster is not in quorum or a healthy controller shows false for eligibility and health, you must correct the issue before shutting down the impaired controller; see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/index.html[Administration overview with the CLI^].

.Steps

. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=_number_of_hours_down_h`
+
The following AutoSupport message suppresses automatic case creation for two hours: `cluster1:*> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=2h`

. If the impaired controller is part of an HA pair, disable automatic giveback from the console of the healthy controller: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback false`
. Take the impaired controller to the LOADER prompt:

System prompt or password prompt (enter system password)

Take over or halt the impaired controller from the healthy controller: `storage failover takeover -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`

When the impaired controller shows Waiting for giveback..., press Ctrl-C, and then respond `y`.
