 .. Clear the status logs: `sldiag device clearstatus`
 .. Verify that the log was cleared: `sldiag device status`
+
The following default response is displayed:
+
SLDIAG: No log messages are present.

 .. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`
+
The controller displays the LOADER prompt.

 .. Boot the controller from the LOADER prompt: `bye`
 .. Return the controller to normal operation:
+
*If your controller is in an HA pair*, perform a give back: `storage failover giveback -ofnode _replacement_node_name_`
+
*Note:* If you disabled automatic giveback, re-enable it with the `storage failover modify` command.
+
*If your controller is in a stand-alone configuration*, proceed to the next step. No action is required.
+
You have completed system-level diagnostics.

Determine the cause of the problem:

 .. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`
+
After you issue the command, wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.

 .. Turn off or leave on the power supplies, depending on how many controller modules are in the chassis:
  *** If you have two controller modules in the chassis, leave the power supplies turned on to provide power to the other controller module.
  *** If you have one controller module in the chassis, turn off the power supplies and unplug them from the power sources.
 .. Verify that you have observed all the considerations identified for running system-level diagnostics, that cables are securely connected, and that hardware components are properly installed in the storage system.
 .. Boot the controller module you are servicing, interrupting the boot by pressing `Ctrl-C` when prompted to get to the Boot menu:
  *** If you have two controller modules in the chassis, fully seat the controller module you are servicing in the chassis.
+
The controller module boots up when fully seated.

  *** If you have one controller module in the chassis, connect the power supplies, and then turn them on.
 .. Select Boot to maintenance mode from the menu.
 .. Exit Maintenance mode by entering the following command: `halt`
+
After you issue the command, wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.

 .. Rerun the system-level diagnostic test.
