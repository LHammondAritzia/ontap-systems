Replacing a power supply involves disconnecting the target power supply (PSU) from the power source, unplugging the power cable, removing the old PSU and installing the replacement PSU, and then reconnecting it to the power source.

* The power supplies are redundant and hot-swappable.
* This procedure is written for replacing one power supply at a time.
+
NOTE: It is a best practice to replace the power supply within two minutes of removing it from the chassis. The system continues to function, but ONTAP sends messages to the console about the degraded power supply until the power supply is replaced.

* Power supplies are auto-ranging.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not mix PSUs with different efficiency ratings. Always replace like for like.

Use the appropriate procedure for your type of PSU; AC or DC.
