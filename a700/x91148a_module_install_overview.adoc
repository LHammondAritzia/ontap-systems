You can add an I/O module to your system by either replacing a NIC or storage adapter with a new one in a fully-populated system, or by adding a new NIC or storage adapter into an empty chassis slot in your system.

.Before you begin

* Check the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe] to make sure that the new I/O module is compatible with your system and version of ONTAP you're running.

* If multiple slots are available, check the slot priorities in https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe]  and use the best one available for your I/O module.

* To non-disruptively add an I/O module, you must takeover the target controller, remove the slot blanking cover in the target slot or remove an existing I/O module, add the new or replacement I/O module, and then giveback the target controller.

* Make sure that all other components are functioning properly.
