.Before you begin
Replacing a power supply involves disconnecting the target power supply (PSU) from the power source, unplugging the power cable, removing the old PSU and installing the replacement PSU, and then reconnecting it to the power source.

* The power supplies are redundant and hot-swappable.
* This procedure is written for replacing one power supply at a time.
+
NOTE: It is a best practice to replace the power supply within two minutes of removing it from the chassis. The system continues to function, but ONTAP sends messages to the console about the degraded power supply until the power supply is replaced.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not mix PSUs with different efficiency ratings or different input types. Always replace like for like.

Use the appropriate procedure for your type of PSU; AC or DC.

.Option 1: Replace an AC power supply
--
To replace an AC power supply, Complete the following steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Identify the power supply you want to replace, based on console error messages or through the red Fault LED on the power supply.
. Disconnect the power supply:
 .. Open the power cable retainer, and then unplug the power cable from the power supply.
 .. Unplug the power cable from the power source.
. Rotate the cam handle such that it can be used to pull power supply out of the controller module while pressing the locking tab.
+
CAUTION: The power supply is short. Always use two hands to support it when removing it from the controller module so that it does not suddenly swing free from the controller module and injure you.

NOTE: To avoid damaging the internal connector, do not use excessive force when sliding the power supply into the system.

. Reconnect the power supply cabling:
 .. Reconnect the power cable to the power supply and the power source.
 .. Secure the power cable to the power supply using the power cable retainer.
