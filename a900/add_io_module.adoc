= Add an I/O module

You can add an I/O module to your system by either replacing a NIC or storage adapter with a new one in a fully-populated system, or by adding a new NIC or storage adapter into an empty chassis slot in your system.

*Before you begin*

* Check the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe] to make sure that the new I/O module is compatible with your system and version of ONTAP you're running.

* If multiple slots are available, check the slot priorities in https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe]  and use the best one available for your I/O module.

* To non-disruptively add an I/O module, you must takeover the target controller, remove the slot blanking cover in the target slot or remove an existing I/O module, add the new or replacement I/O module, and then giveback the target controller.

* Make sure that all other components are functioning properly.

== Option 1: Add the I/O module to a system with open slots

You can add an I/O module into an empty module slot in your system as either a NIC or a storage module for the NS224 storage shelves.

. Shutdown controller A:
 .. Disable automatic giveback: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback false`
 .. Take over the target node: `storage failover takeover -ofnode target_node_name`
+
The console connection shows that the node drops to the LOADER prompt when the takeover is complete.
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Remove the target slot blanking cover:
 .. Depress the lettered and numbered cam button.
 .. Rotate the cam latch down until it is in a horizontal position.
 .. Remove the blanking cover.
. Install the I/O module:
 .. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
 .. Slide the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin.
 .. Push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. If the replacement I/O module is a NIC, cable the module to the data switches.
. Reboot controller A. `boot_ontap`
. Giveback the node from the partner node. `storage failover giveback -ofnode target_node_name`
. Enable automatic giveback if it was disabled: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true`
. If you are using slots 3 and/or 7 for networking, use the `storage port modify -node *_<node name>_* -port *_<port name>_* -mode network` command to convert the slot for networking use.
. Repeat these steps for controller B.
. If you installed a storage I/O module, install and cable your NS224 shelves, as described in https://docs.netapp.com/platstor/topic/com.netapp.doc.hw-ds-nvme-hotadd/GUID-B215753F-F3E6-4FA0-A1E1-B9390B19AD94.html[Hot-adding an NS224 drive shelf].

== Option 2: Add an I/O module in a system with no open slots

[.lead]
You must remove one or more existing NIC or storage modules in your system in order to install one or more I/O modules into your fully-populated system.

Permanently reassign the affected LIFs to a different home port. See https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.onc-sm-help-960/GUID-208BB0B8-3F84-466D-9F4F-6E1542A2BE7D.html[Migrating a LIF] for information about using System Manager to permanently move the LIFs

. Shut down controller A:
 .. Disable automatic giveback: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback false`
 .. Take over the target node: `storage failover takeover -ofnode target_node_name`
+
The console connection shows that the node drops to the LOADER prompt when the takeover is complete.
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug any cabling on the target I/O module.
. Remove the target I/O module from the chassis:
 .. Depress the lettered and numbered cam button.
+
The cam button moves away from the chassis.

 .. Rotate the cam latch down until it is in a horizontal position.
+
The I/O module disengages from the chassis and moves about 1/2 inch out of the I/O slot.

 .. Remove the I/O module from the chassis by pulling on the pull tabs on the sides of the module face.
+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.

. Install the I/O module into the target slot:
 .. Align the I/O module with the edges of the slot.
 .. Slide the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage with the I/O cam pin.
 .. Push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Repeat the remove and install steps to replace additional modules for controller A.
. If the replacement I/O module is a NIC, cable the module or modules to the data switches.
. Reboot controller A. `boot_ontap`
. Giveback the node from the partner node. `storage failover giveback -ofnode target_node_name`
