. Rotate the cam handle so that it completely disengages the controller module from the chassis, and then slide the controller module out of the chassis.

Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

. Place the controller module lid-side up on a stable, flat surface, press the blue button on the cover, slide the cover to the back of the controller module, and then swing the cover up and lift it off of the controller module.
