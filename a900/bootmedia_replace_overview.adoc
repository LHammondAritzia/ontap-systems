The boot media stores a primary and secondary set of system (boot image) files that the system uses when it boots. Depending on your network configuration, you can perform either a nondisruptive or disruptive replacement.

You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to FAT32, with the appropriate amount of storage to hold the image_xxx.tgz.

* The nondisruptive and disruptive methods for replacing a boot media both require you to restore the var file system:
 ** For nondisruptive replacement, the HA pair must be connected to a network to restore the var file system.
 ** For disruptive replacement, you do not need a network connection to restore the var file system, but the process requires two reboots.
* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.
* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct node:
 ** The impaired node is the node on which you are performing maintenance.
 ** The healthy node is the HA partner of the impaired node.
