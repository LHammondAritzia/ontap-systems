This guide gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a typical NetApp system. Use this guide if you want more detailed installation instructions.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

[.lead]
To install your system, you need to create an account on the NetApp Support Site, register your system, and get license keys. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

You need to have access to the Hardware Universe for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system. You might also want to have access to the Release Notes for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.

https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe]

http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Find the Release Notes for your version of ONTAP 9^]

You need to provide the following at your site:

* Rack space for the storage system
* Phillips #2 screwdriver
* Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser

. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.

Powering up the system
|===

. Review the _NetApp ONTAP Configuration Guide_ and collect the required information listed in that guide.
+
https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2862613[ONTAP Configuration Guide]

== Step 2: Install the hardware

[.lead]
You need to install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+
image::../media/drw_9000_lifting_icon.png[]

. Attach cable management devices (as shown).
+
image::../media/drw_9000_cable_management_arms.png[]

. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to your network

[.lead]
You can cable the controllers to your network by using the two-node switchless cluster method or by using the cluster interconnect network.

=== Option 1: Two-node switchless cluster

[.lead]
Management network, data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect ports are cabled on both controllers.

You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the direction of the cable pull-tabs when inserting the cables in the ports. Cable pull-tabs are up for all networking module ports.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_up.gif[]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

. Use the animation or illustration to complete the cabling between the controllers and to the switches:

+

image::../media/drw_a900_tnsc_network_cabling.png[]

+
. To cable your storage, see link:install_detailed_guide.md#[Cabling controllers to drive shelves^]

=== Option 2: Switched cluster

[.lead]
Management network, data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect and HA ports are cabled on to the cluster/HA switch.

You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the direction of the cable pull-tabs when inserting the cables in the ports. Cable pull-tabs are up for all networking module ports.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_up.gif[]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

+

image::../media/drw_a900_switched_network_cabling.png[]

+
. Cable your storage: link:install_detailed_guide.md#[Cabling controllers to drive shelves^]

== Step 4: Cable controllers to drive shelves

=== Option 1: Cable the controllers to DS224C drive shelves

[.lead]
You must cable the shelf-to-shelf connections, and then cable both controllers to the DS224C drive shelves.

The cables are inserted into the drive shelf with the pull-tabs facing down, while the other end of the cable is inserted into the controller storage modules with the pull-tabs up.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.gif[]

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_up.gif[]

. Use the following animation to cable your drive shelves to your controllers.

+
If you have more than one drive shelf stack, see link:../com.netapp.doc.hw-ds-sas3-icg/home.html[Installing and cabling^] for your drive shelf type.
+

. To complete setting up your system, see link:install_detailed_guide.md#[Completing system setup and configuration^]

=== Option 2: Cable the controllers to a single NS224 drive shelf in AFF A900

[.lead]
You must cable each controller to the NSM modules on the NS224 drive shelf on an AFF A900 system.

* Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation. The cable pull-tab for the storage modules are up, while the pull tabs on the shelves are down.
+

+

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.gif[]
+
NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

. Use the following animation or drawings to cable your controllers with two X91153A  storage modules to a single NS224 drive shelf, or use the diagram to cable your controllers with one X91153A  storage module to a single NS224 drive shelf.
+

. To complete setting up your system, see link:install_detailed_guide.md#[Completing system setup and configuration^].

== Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration

[.lead]
You can complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

=== Option 1: If network discovery is enabled

[.lead]
If you have network discovery enabled on your laptop, you can complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

. Use the following animation or drawing  to set one or more drive shelf IDs:
+
If your system has NS224 drive shelves, the shelves are pre-set to shelf ID 00 and 01. If you want to change the shelf IDs, you must create a tool to insert into the hole where button is located.
