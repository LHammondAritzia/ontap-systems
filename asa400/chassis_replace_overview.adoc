To replace the chassis, you must move the fans and controller modules from the impaired chassis to the new chassis of the same model as the impaired chassis.

All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.
* This procedure is disruptive. For a two-node cluster, you will have a complete service outage and a partial outage in a multinode cluster.
