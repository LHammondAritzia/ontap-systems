You must verify the HA state of the chassis.

== Step 1: Verify and setting the HA state of the chassis

You must verify the HA state of the chassis, and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

. In Maintenance mode, from either controller module, display the HA state of the local controller module and chassis:
+
`*ha-config show*`
+
The HA state should be the same for all components.

. If the displayed system state for the chassis does not match your system configuration:
 .. Set the HA state for the chassis:
+
`*ha-config modify chassis _HA-state_*`
+
The value for `_HA-state_` can be one of the following:

  *** `ha`
  *** `non-ha`

 .. Confirm that the setting has changed:
+
`*ha-config show*`
. If you have not already done so, recable the rest of your system.
. Reboot the system.


== Step 2: Return the failed part to NetApp
