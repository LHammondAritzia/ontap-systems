Replacing a power supply (PSU) involves disconnecting the target PSU from the power source, unplugging the power cable, removing the old PSU and installing the replacement PSU, and then reconnecting it to the power source.

* The PSUs are redundant and hot-swappable.
* This procedure is written for replacing one PSU at a time.
+
NOTE: It is a best practice to replace the PSU within two minutes of removing it from the chassis. The system continues to function, but ONTAP sends messages to the console about the degraded PSU until the PSU is replaced.

* PSUs are auto-ranging.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not mix PSUs with different efficiency ratings. Always replace like for like.

Use the appropriate procedure for your type of PSU: AC or DC.

.Option 1: Replace an AC PSU
--
Use the following video or the steps to replace the PSU:

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Identify the PSU you want to replace, based on console error messages or through the red Fault LED on the PSU.
. Disconnect the PSU:
 .. Open the power cable retainer, and then unplug the power cable from the PSU.
 .. Unplug the power cable from the power source.
. Rotate the cam handle such that it can be used to pull the PSU out of the controller module while pressing the locking tab.
+
CAUTION: The PSU is short. Always use two hands to support it when removing it from the controller module so that it does not suddenly swing free from the controller module and injure you.

. Using both hands, support and align the edges of the PSU with the opening in the controller module, and then gently push the PSU into the controller module until the locking tab clicks into place.
+
The PSUs will only properly engage with the internal connector and lock in place one way.
+
NOTE: To avoid damaging the internal connector, do not use excessive force when sliding the PSU into the system.

. Reconnect the PSU cabling:
 .. Reconnect the power cable to the PSU and the power source.
 .. Secure the power cable to the PSU using the power cable retainer.

+
Once power is restored to the PSU, the status LED should be green.

.Option 2: Replace a DC PSU
--
To replace a DC PSU, complete the following steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Identify the PSU you want to replace, based on console error messages or through the red Fault LED on the PSU.
. Disconnect the PSU: 
.. Unscrew the two thumb screws on the D-SUB DC power cable connector.
+
The illustration and table in step 4 shows the two thumb screws (item #1) and the D-SUB DC power cable connector (item #2).
.. Unplug the D-SUB DC power cable connector from the PSU and set it aside.

. Remove the PSU:
.. Rotate the handle up, to its horizontal position, and then grasp it.
.. With your thumb, press the blue tab to release the locking mechanism.
.. Pull the PSU out of the controller module while using your other hand to support its weight.
+
NOTE: The PSU is short. Always use two hands to support it when removing it from the controller module so that it does not swing free from the controller module and injure you.

. Install the replacement PSU:
.. Using both hands, support and align the edges of the PSU with the opening in the controller module.
.. Gently push the PSU into the controller module until the locking mechanism clicks into place.
+
A PSU must properly engage with the internal connector and locking mechanism. Repeat this step if you feel the PSU is not properly seated.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force or you might damage the internal connector.

.. Rotate the handle down, so it is out of the way of normal operations.
. Reconnect the D-SUB DC power cable:
+
Once power is restored to the PSU, the status LED should be green.
+
.. Plug the D-SUB DC power cable connector into the PSU.
.. Tighten the two thumb screws to secure the D-SUB DC power cable connector to the PSU.
