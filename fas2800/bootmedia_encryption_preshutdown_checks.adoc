 If <lno-DARE> is not displayed in the command output, and the system is running ONTAP 9.6 or later, check NVE or NSE as described below.

If the impaired controller is part of an HA configuration, disable automatic giveback from the healthy controller: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback false` or `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback-after-panic false`

== Check NVE or NSE on systems running ONTAP 9.6 and later
