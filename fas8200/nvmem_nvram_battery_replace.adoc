[.lead]
To replace an NVMEM battery in the system, you must remove the controller module from the system, open it, replace the battery, and close and replace the controller module.

All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller

[.lead]
You can shut down or take over the impaired controller using different procedures, depending on the storage system hardware configuration.

=== Option 1: Most configurations

[.lead]
include::../_include/shutdown_most_frus.adoc[]


=== Option 2: Controller is in a two-node MetroCluster

[.lead]
include::../_include/shutdown_2n_mcc.adoc[]

== Step 2: Open the controller module

[.lead]
To access components inside the controller, you must first remove the controller module from the system and then remove the cover on the controller module.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFPs (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Remove and set aside the cable management devices from the left and right sides of the controller module.
+

. Loosen the thumbscrew on the cam handle on the controller module.

. Pull the cam handle downward and begin to slide the controller module out of the chassis.
+
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

== Step 3: Replace the NVMEM battery

[.lead]
To replace the NVMEM battery in your system, you must remove the failed NVMEM battery from the system and replace it with a new NVMEM battery.

. Check the NVMEM LED:
 ** If your system is in an HA configuration, go to the next step.
 ** If your system is in a stand-alone configuration, cleanly shut down the controller module, and then check the NVRAM LED identified by the NV icon.
+
image::../media/drw_hw_nvram_icon.gif[]
+
NOTE: The NVRAM LED blinks while destaging contents to the flash memory when you halt the system. After the destage is complete, the LED turns off.

  *** If power is lost without a clean shutdown, the NVMEM LED flashes until the destage is complete, and then the LED turns off.
  *** If the LED is on and power is on, unwritten data is stored on NVMEM.
+
This typically occurs during an uncontrolled shutdown after ONTAP has successfully booted.
. Open the CPU air duct and locate the NVMEM battery.

. Grasp the battery and press the blue locking tab marked PUSH, and then lift the battery out of the holder and controller module.
. Remove the replacement battery from its package.
. Align the tab or tabs on the battery holder with the notches in the controller module side, and then gently push down on the battery housing until the battery housing clicks into place.
. Close the CPU air duct.
+
Make sure that the plug locks down to the socket.

== Step 4: Reinstall the controller

[.lead]
After you replace a component within the controller module, you must reinstall the controller module in the system chassis and boot it to a state where you can run diagnostic tests on the replaced component.

. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the system, as needed.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis. Be prepared to interrupt the boot process.

 .. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller module in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.

 .. Tighten the thumbscrew on the cam handle on back of the controller module.
 .. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
 .. Bind the cables to the cable management device with the hook and loop strap.
 .. As each node starts the booting, press `Ctrl-C` to interrupt the boot process when you see the message `Press Ctrl-C for Boot Menu`.
 .. Select the option to boot to Maintenance mode from the displayed menu.

== Step 5: Run system-level diagnostics

[.lead]
After installing a new NVMEM battery, you should run diagnostics.

Your system must be at the LOADER prompt to start System Level Diagnostics.

All commands in the diagnostic procedures are issued from the node where the component is being replaced.

. If the node to be serviced is not at the LOADER prompt, perform the following steps:
 .. Select the Maintenance mode option from the displayed menu.
 .. After the node boots to Maintenance mode, halt the node: `halt`
+
After you issue the command, you should wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.
+
NOTE: During the boot process, you can safely respond `y` to prompts:

  *** A prompt warning that when entering Maintenance mode in an HA configuration, you must ensure that the healthy node remains down.
. At the LOADER prompt, access the special drivers specifically designed for system-level diagnostics to function properly: `boot_diags`
+
During the boot process, you can safely respond `y` to the prompts until the Maintenance mode prompt (*>) appears.

. Run diagnostics on the NVMEM memory: `sldiag device run -dev nvmem`
. Verify that no hardware problems resulted from the replacement of the NVMEM battery: `sldiag device status -dev nvmem -long -state failed`
+
System-level diagnostics returns you to the prompt if there are no test failures, or lists the full status of failures resulting from testing the component.

. Proceed based on the result of the preceding step:
+
[options="header" cols="1,2"]

| If the system-level diagnostics tests...| Then...
a|
Were completed without any failures
a|

 .. Clear the status logs: `sldiag device clearstatus`
 .. Verify that the log was cleared: `sldiag device status`
+
The following default response is displayed:
+
SLDIAG: No log messages are present.

 .. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`
+
The node displays the LOADER prompt.

 .. Boot the node from the LOADER prompt: `bye`
 .. Return the node to normal operation:

An HA pair

Perform a give back: `storage failover giveback -ofnode _replacement_node_name_`

NOTE: If you disabled automatic giveback, re-enable it with the storage failover modify command.

A two-node MetroCluster configuration
a|
Proceed to the next step.         The MetroCluster switchback procedure is done in the next task in the replacement process.
a|
A stand-alone configuration
a|
Proceed to the next step.         No action is required. You have completed system-level diagnostics.
a|
Resulted in some test failures
a|
Determine the cause of the problem:

 .. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`
+
After you issue the command, wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.

 .. Turn off or leave on the power supplies, depending on how many controller modules are in the chassis:
  *** If you have two controller modules in the chassis, leave the power supplies turned on to provide power to the other controller module.
  *** If you have one controller module in the chassis, turn off the power supplies and unplug them from the power sources.
 .. Verify that you have observed all the considerations identified for running system-level diagnostics, that cables are securely connected, and that hardware components are properly installed in the storage system.
 .. Boot the controller module you are servicing, interrupting the boot by pressing `Ctrl-C` when prompted to get to the Boot menu:
  *** If you have two controller modules in the chassis, fully seat the controller module you are servicing in the chassis.
+
The controller module boots up when fully seated.

  *** If you have one controller module in the chassis, connect the power supplies, and then turn them on.
 .. Select Boot to maintenance mode from the menu.
 .. Exit Maintenance mode by entering the following command: `halt`
+
After you issue the command, wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.

 .. Rerun the system-level diagnostic test.
