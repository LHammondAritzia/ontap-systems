After completing the hardware replacement and booting to Maintenance mode, you verify the low-level system configuration of the replacement controller and reconfigure system settings as necessary.

== Step 1: Set and verify system time after replacing the controller

== Step 2:  Verify and set the HA state of the controller module

[.lead]
You must verify the `HA` state of the controller module and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

. In Maintenance mode from the new controller module, verify that all components display the same `HA` state: `ha-config show`
+
The HA state should be the same for all components.

. If the displayed system state of the controller module does not match your system configuration, set the `HA` state for the controller module: `ha-config modify controller ha-state`

+
The value for HA-state can be one of the following:

  *** ha
  *** mcc
  *** mcc-2n
  *** non-ha

  . If the displayed system state of the controller module does not match your system configuration, set the `HA` state for the controller module: `ha-config modify controller ha-state`
  . Confirm that the setting has changed: `ha-config show`

== Step 3: Run diagnostics

[.lead]
After you have replaced a component in your system, you should run diagnostic tests on that component.

Your system must be at the LOADER prompt to start diagnostics.

All commands in the diagnostic procedures are issued from the node where the component is being replaced.

. If the node to be serviced is not at the LOADER prompt, reboot the node: `system node halt -node node_name`
+
After you issue the command, you should wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.

. At the LOADER prompt, access the special drivers specifically designed for system-level diagnostics to function properly: `boot_diags`
. Select *Scan System* from the displayed menu to enable running the diagnostics tests.
. Select *Test system* from the displayed menu to run diagnostics tests.
. Select the test or series of tests from the various sub-menus.
. Proceed based on the result of the preceding step:
 ** If the test failed, correct the failure, and then rerun the test.
 ** If the test reported no failures, select Reboot from the menu to reboot the system.
+
NOTE: During the boot process, you might see the following prompts:

  *** A prompt warning of a system ID mismatch and asking to override the system ID.
  *** A prompt warning that when entering Maintenance mode in an HA configuration you must ensure that the healthy node remains down.
You can safely respond `y` to these prompts.
