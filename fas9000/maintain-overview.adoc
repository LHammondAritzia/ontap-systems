[.lead]
For the FAS9000 storage system, you can perform maintenance procedures on the following components.

== Boot media

The boot media stores a primary and secondary set of boot image files that the system uses when it boots. 

== Caching module
You must replace the controllerâ€™s caching module when your system registers a single AutoSupport (ASUP) message that the module has gone offline.

== Chassis

The chassis is the physical enclosure housing all the controller components such as the controller/CPU unit, power supply, and I/O.

== Controller

A controller consists of a board, firmware, and software. It controls the drives and implements the ONTAP functions.

== DCPM

The DCPM (destage controller power module) contains the NVRAM11 battery.

== DIMM

You must replace a DIMM (dual in-line memory module) when a memory mismatch is present, or you have a failed DIMM.

== Fan

The fan cools the controller.

== I/O module

The  I/O module (Input/Output module) is a hardware component that acts as an intermediary between the controller and various devices or systems that need to exchange data with the controller.

== LED USB

The LED USB module provides connectivity to console ports and system status. 

== NVRAM

The NVRAM module (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory) allows the controller to retain data across power cycles or system reboots.

== Power supply

A power supply provides a redundant power source in a controller shelf.

== Real-time clock battery

A real time clock battery preserves system date and time information if the power is off. 

== X91148A module

The X91148A module is an I/O module that acts as an intermediary between the controller and various devices or systems that need to exchange data with the controller.
