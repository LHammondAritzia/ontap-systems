To complete the replacement procedure and restore your system to full operation, you must recable the storage, restore the NetApp Storage Encryption configuration (if necessary), and install licenses for the new controller. You must complete a series of tasks before restoring your system to full operation.

== Step 1: Install licenses for the replacement node in ONTAP

== Step 2: Verify LIFs and registering the serial number

include::../_include/check_lifs_register_serial_number.adoc[]

== Step 3: Return the failed part to NetApp
