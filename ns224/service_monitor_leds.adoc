You can monitor the health of your drive shelf by understanding the location and status conditions of the LEDs on your drive shelf components.

== Operator display panel LEDs

The LEDs on the drive shelf front operator display panel indicate whether your drive shelf is functioning normally or there are problems with the hardware.

The following illustration and table describes the three LEDs on the operator display panel:

Attention
a|
Solid amber
a|
* An error occurred with the function of one of more shelf FRUs.
+
Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.
* The shelf ID is in a pending state.
+
Power cycle the drive shelf for the shelf ID to take affect.

Location
a|
Solid blue
a|
The system administrator activated this LED function to aid in physically locating the drive shelf requiring service.

The location LED on the operator display panel and both NSM modules illuminate when this LED function is activated. Location LEDs automatically turn off after 30 minutes.

== NSM module LEDs

The LEDs on the NSM module indicate whether the module is functioning normally, whether it is ready for I/O traffic, and whether there are any problems with the hardware.

The following illustration and table describes NSM module LEDs associated with the function of the module and the function of each NVMe port on the module.

== Power supply LEDs

The LEDs on an AC or DC power supply (PSU) indicate whether the PSU is functioning normally or there are hardware problems.

The following illustration and table describes the bi-colored LED on a PSU. (The illustration is an AC PSU; however, the LED location is the same on the DC PSU):
