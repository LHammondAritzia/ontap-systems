You can monitor the health of your drive shelf by understanding the location and status conditions of the LEDs on your drive shelf components.

== Operator display panel LEDs

The LEDs on the drive shelf front operator display panel indicate whether your drive shelf is functioning normally or there are problems with the hardware.

The following table describes the three LEDs on the operator display panel:

[cols="4*",options="header"]

Power
a|
Solid green
a|
One or more power supplies are supplying power to the drive shelf.

* An error occurred with the function of one of more shelf FRUs.
+
Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.
* The shelf ID is in a pending state.
+
Power cycle the drive shelf for the shelf ID to take affect.

The system administrator activated this LED function to aid in physically locating the drive shelf requiring service.

The location LED on the operator display panel and both NSM modules illuminate when this LED function is activated. Location LEDs automatically turn off after 30 minutes.

== NSM module LEDs

The LEDs on the NSM module indicate whether the module is functioning normally, whether it is ready for I/O traffic, and whether there are any problems with the hardware.

The following table describes NSM module LEDs associated with the function of the module and the function of each NVMe port on the module.

Attention
a|
Solid amber

NSM module function: An error occurred with the function of the IOM12/IOM12B module.

NVMe port function: Less than all four SAS lanes established a link (with either an adapter or another disk shelf).

Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.

The system administrator activated this LED function to aid in physically locating the disk shelf with the failed IOM12/IOM12B module.

The location LED on the operator display panel and both IOM12/IOM12B modules illuminate when this LED function is activated. Location LEDs automatically turn off after 30 minutes.

== Power supply LEDs

The LEDs on the power supply indicate whether the power supply is functioning normally or there are hardware problems.

The following table describes the two LEDs on a power supply:

Power
a|
Solid green
a|
The power supply is functioning correctly.
a|
Off
a|
The power supply failed, the AC switch is turned off, the AC power cord is not properly installed, or electricity is not being properly supplied to the power supply.

Check event messages to determine corrective action to take.
