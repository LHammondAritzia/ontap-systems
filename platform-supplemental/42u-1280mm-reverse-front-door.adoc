You can change the direction the front door opens by removing the illuminated badge, door, top hinge, and related hardware, and then installing them on the opposite side of the front of the system cabinet frame.

You need the following tools and equipment to complete the door reversal for system cabinets with illuminated badges:

* A Phillips screwdriver
* A 5-mm Allen wrench; magnetic Allen wrench is recommended
* Needle-nose pliers
* A step ladder so that you can easily access the Allen bolts in the top hinge
