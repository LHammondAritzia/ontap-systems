You can use the completed controller-to-stack cabling worksheets and cabling examples to cable platforms with internal storage, including FAS2600 series, AFF A200, FAS2700 series, AFF A220, and later.

NOTE: This information does not apply to FAS25XX platforms.

* If needed, you can refer to link:install-cabling-rules.html[SAS cabling rules] for information about supported configurations, shelf-to-shelf connectivity, and controller-to-shelf connectivity.
* Cabling examples show controller-to-stack cables as solid or dashed to distinguish controller 0b port connections from controller 0a port connections.

* Cabling examples show controller-to-stack connections and shelf-to-shelf connections in two different colors to distinguish connectivity through IOM A (domain A) and IOM B (domain B).

== AFF and FAS platforms with onboard storage in a multipath HA configuration with one multi-shelf stack

The following worksheet and cabling example uses port pair 0a/0b:

== FAS2600 series multipath configuration with one multi-shelf stack

The following worksheets and cabling examples use port pair 0a/0b.

In this example, the controller is installed in slot A of the chassis. When a controller is located in slot A of the chassis, its internal storage port (0b) is in domain A (IOM A); therefore, port 0b must connect to domain A (IOM A) in the stack.

In this example, the controller is installed in slot B of the chassis. When a controller is located in slot B of the chassis, its internal storage port (0b) is in domain B (IOM B); therefore, port 0b must connect to domain B (IOM B) in the stack.
