The node with the new controller boots and attempts to join the cluster automatically at first; however if the new node has a different set of network ports, you must perform the following steps to ensure that the node successfully joins the quorum.

.About this task

You can use these instructions for any relevant node. Node3 is used throughout the following
sample.

.Steps

. Verify that the new cluster ports are in the Cluster broadcast domain by entering the following command and checking its output:
+
`network port show -node node -port port -fields broadcast-domain`
+
The following example shows that port "e1a" is in the Cluster domain on node3:
+
`cluster::> network port show -node node3 -port e1a -fields broadcast-domain
node port broadcast-domain
------ ---- ----------------
node3 e1a Cluster
2. Add the correct ports to the Cluster broadcast domain by entering the following command and
checking its output:
network port modify -node -port -ipspace Cluster -mtu 9000
This example adds Cluster port e1b on node3:
network port modify -node node3 -port e1b -ipspace Cluster -mtu 9000
3. Migrate the cluster LIFs to the new ports, once for each LIF, using the following command:
network interface migrate -vserver Cluster -lif lif_name -source-node node3 -
destination-node node3 -destination-port port_name
4. Modify the home port of the cluster LIFs as follows:
network interface modify -vserver Cluster -lif lif_name â€“home-port port_name
5. If the cluster ports are not in the Cluster broadcast-domain, add them with the following
command:
network port broadcast-domain add-ports -ipspace Cluster -broadcastdomain Cluster -
ports node:port
// This is for the stage 3 procedure.  There is a similar procedure in Stage 5.
