If you are using NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) to encrypt volumes on the system you are upgrading, the encryption configuration must be synchronized to the new nodes. Encrypted volumes are taken offline when ARL is complete for node1 aggregates from node2 to node4.

.Steps

. To synchronize encryption configuration for Onboard Key Manager, run the following command at the cluster prompt:
+
|===
|For this ONTAP versionâ€¦ |Use this command...

|ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7 |security key-manager onboard sync
|ONTAP 9.5 |security key-manager setup -node <node_name>
|===

. Enter the cluster-wide passphrase for the Onboard Key Manager.
