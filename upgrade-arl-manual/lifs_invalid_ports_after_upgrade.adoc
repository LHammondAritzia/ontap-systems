After the upgrade is completed, the FC logical interfaces (LIFs) might be left on incorrect ports if you have a MetroCluster configuration. You can perform a resync operation to reassign the LIFs to the correct ports.

.Step

Enter the `metrocluster vserver resync` command to reallocate the LIFs to the correct ports.

`metrocluster vserver resync -vserver vserver_name fcp-mc.headupgrade.test.vs`
