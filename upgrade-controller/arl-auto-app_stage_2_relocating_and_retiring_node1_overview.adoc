During Stage 2, you relocate the node1 aggregates and LIFs to node2, record node1 information, and then retire node1. This process is largely automated; the operation pauses to allow you to check its status. You must manually resume the operation.

*Steps*

. *xref* Relocating non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs owned by node1 to node2 
. *xref* Retiring node1 
. *xref* Preparing for netboot
